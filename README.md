<h1>Project: Automation and backup </h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This project streamlines tasks related to the ALU Negpod assignments through two shell scripts:

1. move-to-directory.sh

Functionality:
Automatically moves the four files created in Question 1 (main.sh, students-list_1023.txt, select-emails.sh, and student-emails.txt) to a directory named negpod_11-q1.
Usage:
Execute the script from the project directory: ./move-to-directory.sh
2. backup-Negpod_11.sh

Functionality:
Creates a backup of the directory created in Question 2 (containing the files from Question 1) to a remote server.


<h3>Testing Backup:</h3>

1.Create a test directory with the same structure as the one you want to back up.
2.Run the backup-Negpod_11.sh script with the test directory path.
3.Verify that the test directory contents are successfully copied to the remote server location.
